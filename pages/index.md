Hey, I am Kitiho, a front-end developer and also a learner of creative programing.

I worked in ByteDance Ltd. before but now I'm a kind of freelancer although I still worked for a tiny company in my hometown, ChongQing in China.<br>

私は昔日本に二年間留学したことがあります。東京で一年間、大阪で一年間です。今も日本の文化とか環境などのことがすごく好きで、よろしければ、日本語で話し合ってもいいですよ。

I'm very interested in all kinds of amazing effects which created by web technology, and that's also the reason I start my front-end career.Currently I'm still a learner about creative programing, and I've already acquired the basic knowledge of Three.js. I'll keep moving on!

This Website is basically used for recording my study progress and do some notes or something like that.

And you can find my [full projects list here](/projects), [some simple notes here](/notes), and [my posts here](/posts).
